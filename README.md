# project-landing-page

This is the second project from "the odin project" based on the web elements
that I have learned using html, css and the element from html called "Flex-Box"
which is a a "one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or
columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into 
smaller spaces." - Mozilla.org -. 

What did I learned in this project?

<ul>
<li>Flex-Box</li>
</ul>
